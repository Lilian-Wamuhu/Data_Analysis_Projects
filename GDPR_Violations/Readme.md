Given the rise in use of data and the proliferation of companies such as Google whose business models are hinged on the value of user data, regulatory bodies have been forced to implement data protection and privacy regulations across the globe, for instance the GDPR, EU based. Locally in Kenya we have the Data Protection Act, which is based on the aforementioned. Following the implementation of the GDPR in the EU countries a number of countries have faced fines related to different articles violated.

**What are GDPR Fines and Penalties**

Failure to comply with GDPR will result in hefty fines or strict actions, depending on the violation. Severe violation will subject to 4% of annual global turnover or €20 million – whichever is higher. Less severe violation will subject to 2% of annual global turnover or €10 million – whichever is higher. Other actions include written warning, temporary or permanent ban, data deletion, and restriction on data transfers. Ultimately this leads to a loss in trust and reputation.
