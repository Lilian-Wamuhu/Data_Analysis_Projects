Given the rise in the use of data and the proliferation of companies such as Google whose business models are hinged on the value of user data, regulatory bodies have been forced to implement data protection and privacy regulations across the globe, for instance the GDPR, EU based. Locally in Kenya we have the Data Protection Act, which is based on the aforementioned.

This analysis seeks to explore GDPR violations by country and article, companies with the highest violations, and fines levied per article.

**What are GDPR Fines and Penalties**

Failure to comply with GDPR will result in hefty fines or strict actions, depending on the violation. Severe violation will subject to 4% of annual global turnover or €20 million – whichever is higher. Less severe violation will subject to 2% of annual global turnover or €10 million – whichever is higher. Other actions include written warning, temporary or permanent ban, data deletion, and restriction on data transfers. Ultimately this leads to a loss in trust and reputation.
