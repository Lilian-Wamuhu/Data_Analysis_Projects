The data used provides a summary of a pay-walled Nature article about the effects of volcanic eruptions on global climate over the past 2,500 years. The article uses tree ring records to match the effects of eruptions on climate and reinforces evidence that volcanic eruptions can have long-lasting global effects. It also mentions specific historical accounts, including the impact of volcanic eruptions in the sixth-century Roman Empire and their potential contribution to the decline of the Maya empire.

**What is volcanic eruption?**

>A volcanic eruption is the release of magma, ash, gases, and other materials from a volcano. Eruptions can range from relatively mild to extremely violent, and can have various impacts on the environment and human populations. The severity of an eruption depends on various factors such as the composition of the magma, the gas content, and the structure of the volcano.

>During an eruption, magma rises from the Earth's mantle and accumulates in a magma chamber beneath the volcano. As the magma continues to accumulate, it may reach a critical pressure point and force its way to the surface through vents or fissures in the Earth's crust. The release of pressure causes the magma to explosively decompress, leading to the expulsion of ash, gas, and other materials into the atmosphere.

**Impacts of volcanic eruption**

>The analysis confirmed that volcanic eruptions can have long-lasting global effects on the climate, including cooling temperatures and changes in precipitation patterns. The study also provides insights into historical events, such as the sixth-century Roman Empire, where the atmosphere had dimmed for 18 months due to a large eruption that injected large amounts of sulfate and ash into the atmosphere. The study suggests that this eruption, along with another eruption in 539 or 540, may have contributed to the decline of the Maya empire and caused famines and pandemics

>The impacts of a volcanic eruption can be significant, including destruction of property and infrastructure, loss of life, and long-term changes to the landscape. Eruptions can also have global impacts on the climate and air quality, particularly if large amounts of ash and gas are released into the atmosphere. Understanding the nature of volcanic eruptions and their potential impacts is important for mitigating the risks associated with living in areas prone to volcanic activity.

## Data Exploration

**_Category of volcanoes that have the highest effects on population._**

>From the analysis, the category of volcanoes that have the highest effects on population are those with Stratovolcano. Stratovolcanoes, also known as composite volcanoes, are tall, steep-sided volcanic mountains built from alternating layers of lava and ash. They are typically cone-shaped and have a symmetrical appearance. Stratovolcanoes are some of the most destructive and deadly volcanoes, as they can produce explosive eruptions that eject large amounts of ash, lava, and other volcanic materials. These eruptions can cause significant damage to nearby communities, including the destruction of buildings, roads, and other infrastructure, as well as loss of life due to ash fall, pyroclastic flows, and lahars. Examples of stratovolcanoes include Mount St. Helens in the United States, Mount Fuji in Japan, and Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines.

>Its followed by Complex Volcanic field, Caldera, Pyroclastic cone(s), Lava dome(s), Shield, Caldera(s), Maar(s) and Pyroclastic cone.

**_Visualization of the tectonic plates around the globe_**

>The Earth's surface is made up of rock slabs that are gently moving directly under our feet, according to the plate tectonic theory. Today's Earth is very different from what it was millions of years ago due to its constant movement.
Here is a visualization of the tectonic plates around the globe:

>The largest tectonic plates are the Pacific Plate, the North American Plate, the Eurasian Plate, the African Plate, the Antarctic Plate, and the South American Plate. The boundaries between plates are where earthquakes and volcanic activity are most likely to occur.

**_Locations of most active volcanoes since 1800_**

>Volcanic eruptions don't just happen randomly, they only happen in specified regions. This is due to the Earth's crust being divided into a number of tectonic plates. Although these plates are rigid, they "float" on a hotter, softer layer in the Earth's interior. As the plates move, they spread apart, collide, or slide past each other.
>Sixty percent of all active volcanoes occur at the boundaries between tectonic plates. Most volcanoes are found along a belt, called the “Ring of Fire” that encircles the Pacific Ocean.

>The above data supports the theory that Japan, Indonesia, United States, Russia and Iceland are the top 5 locations with the most active volcanoes since 1800.
