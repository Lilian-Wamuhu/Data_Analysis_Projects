Food, like everything else we buy, has a carbon footprint. Five billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent are produced annually by agriculture and livestock production. It's easy to overlook how much work goes into producing our food, from seed to mouth. So here are a few facts you might not know about the carbon footprint of your favorite dishes.

## What is Carbon Footprint?

The carbon footprint is the amount of greenhouse gases—measured in carbon dioxide—emitted into the atmosphere as a result of an individual, family, organization, or nation's activities. Industrial activities and energy consumption are the first things that come to mind when thinking about the components that make up the carbon footprint. But, among the most significant contributors to a carbon footprint are trash production, animal husbandry, and the habits people develop to do daily tasks fast.

## METHODOLOGY

This study looks at 130 countries around the world to determine how much carbon dioxide (CO2) each country emits, based on their diet. This is calculated through the amount of food supplied for consumption and how many kgs of CO2 per kg of produce, per person annually. This country-level data is split between animal-based and non-animal based diets.

The data looks at the amount of animal produce (pork, poultry, beef, lamb & goat, fish, eggs, and milk – including cheese) and non-animal produce (wheat and wheat products, rice, soybeans, nuts- including peanut butter) which is supplied for consumption in each country.

From the data we analyze:

**1. The average C02 emission per person by food category among five countries (Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda and Ethiopia) located in East Africa.**

>East Africa is a representative example of the less developed economies that have emerged since the twenty-first century, whose magnificent economic miracle has also fueled the rapid growth of food consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. According to the research, a significant portion of East Africa's carbon dioxide emissions were produced in Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. The country with the highest emission rate being Kenya and is more industrialized with substantial CO2 emission while Rwanda has the lowest.

**2. The food consumption of animal and non-animal products and the impact on carbon footprint.**

>Overall, animal-based food have a higher environmental impact than plant-based food. Each kilogram of lamb and cheese emits more than 20 kilograms of CO2-equivalents. Pork and poultry both have smaller environmental footprints than the majority of plant-based foods, at 6 and 7 kg CO2-equivalents, respectively. On average, most greenhouse gas emissions from plant-based foods are lower than those in animal-based foods.

**3. Beef's contribution to CO2 emissions (kg/person/year)**

>Have you ever considered beef's carbon footprint? Although you might not be aware of it, beef has the highest greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of any food group and the largest carbon footprint among protein-rich foods. One kilogram of beef (beef herd) produces an average of 99.48 kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent (kg CO2eq), while one kilogram of poultry meat produces less than 10 kg CO2eq.

>Cattle release methane through their burps (and other actions) as a result of this process, known as enteric fermentation. A significant amount of methane in the environment accelerates climate change because it is a GHG. But the cattle's role in the environmental effects of the meat and dairy industries does not end there. Methane and nitrous oxide are both released by the waste that cattle produce.

# SUMMARY

**a. Does my diet affect the rate of climate change? Yes.**

>Roughly one-fourth of the planet-warming greenhouse gases that people produce annually are caused by the global food system. All the plants, animals, and animal products we consume, such as beef, chicken, fish, milk, lentils, kale, and other foods, must be grown, harvested, processed, packaged, and transported to markets around the world. You are a part of this system if you consume food.

**b. What specific ways does food affect global warming? Numerous ways.**

>Here are the four largest: Large stores of carbon are released into the atmosphere when forests are cut down to make room for farms and livestock, this heats the planet. Methane, another potent greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change, is released during the digestion process in cows, sheep, and goats. Large methane sources include rice fields and animal manure. Finally, using fossil fuels to run agricultural equipment, produce fertilizer, and transport food around the world all results in emissions.

From the questions above we can conclude that there are simple food choices we can make that would reduce carbon footprint. We can reduce consumption of red meat and dairy. Going vegan is not a requirement in this situation but one could simply consume fewer of the beef, lamb, and cheese foods, which have the largest carbon footprints and alternatively consume pork, chicken, eggs, and fish which are good because they have a smaller environmental impact. However, plant-based foods like beans, grains, and soy are typically the most environmentally friendly choices.
